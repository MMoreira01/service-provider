# Service Provider

This repository serves as service provider that will use the [identity provider repository](https://github.com/MMoreira01/identity-provider) to authenticate users.

This should run on port 8001 and the identity provider should run on port 8000.

The Service Provider is a simulated Academic Papers Repository,where the user can login by using the Identity Provider Plataform, in this case the Muudal Plataform. After he authorizes the access, he can navigate freely through the platform, and see the papers that are available.
